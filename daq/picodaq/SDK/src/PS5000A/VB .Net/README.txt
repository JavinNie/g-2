PicoScope 5000 (A API) VB .NET Example
======================================

This is a basic VB .NET Console example that demonstrates how to open a connection to a PicoScope 5000 series oscilloscope and capture block data using the ps5000a driver.

The example will output information about the device, capture a block of data using a trigger and then close the connection.

Please note how the data types are defined for the function declarations in relation to the PicoScope 5000 Series (A API) PC Oscilloscope Programmer's Guide.
